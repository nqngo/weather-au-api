# weather-au-api
NodeJS API library for accessing api.weather.bom.gov.au

This API is inspired by [tonyallan/weather-au](https://github.com/tonyallan/weather-au).

As the API is reversed engineered from the usage in https://weather.bom.gov.au with no information about future access arrangements or availability, use this module as your own risks.
